-- Verify Table Removal Script
-- This script checks the current state after removing unused tables

-- 1. Check which tables still exist in the database

FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'

-- 2. Verify that the 5 unused tables have been removed

-- 5. List all remaining tables for reference
